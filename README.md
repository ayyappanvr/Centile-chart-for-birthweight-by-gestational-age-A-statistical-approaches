# Centile-chart-for-birthweight-by-gestational-age-A-statistical-approaches
### Introduction
A centile chart is used as a screening tool in the identification of fetuses or newborns as small, appropriate, or large for a specified GA, based on specified centiles on a reference chart.  

### Aim
This paper described or demonstrated statistical approaches used to construct a centile chart of birthweight according to each gestational week.

### Statistical Approaches
1. Cubic polynomial regression
2. Fractional polynomial regressions
3. LMS, LMST, and LMSP methods (GAMLSS)

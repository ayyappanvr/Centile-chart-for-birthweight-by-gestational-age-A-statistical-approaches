# Centile-chart-for-birthweight-by-gestational-age-A-statistical-approaches
Centile or reference charts are easy-to-use tools that can help determine whether birth weight is appropriate for the corresponding age. It depicts smoothed birth weight curves across ages are routinely used to assess birth weight for gestational age in clinical practices. Care providers are especially interested to know whether an infant is a small-for-gestational age (SGA) because of the associated higher risk of mortality and morbidity. A centile chart would help clinicians in making judgments to avoid complications that are associated with risk factors. Actual values outside extreme centiles are indicative of growth restriction, excessive growth, or other clinical complications affecting growth. A centile chart is used as a screening tool in the identification of fetuses or newborns as small, appropriate, or large for a specified GA, based on specified centiles on a reference chart.  This paper described or demonstrated statistical approaches used to construct a centile chart of birthweight according to each gestational week.
